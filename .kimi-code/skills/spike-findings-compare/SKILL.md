## Project: Compare

Compare needs a source picker that remains responsive in repositories with 10,000 local branches by exposing the current branch and registered worktrees before searchable branch discovery.

Spike sessions wrapped: 2026-07-30

<requirements>
## Requirements

- The ordered source picker must be usable within 400 ms from process start.
- Initial choices use Git state only: the current branch and registered worktrees.
- First branch-search results must appear within 500 ms with 10,000 local branches.
- Branch discovery must not invoke a serial Git subprocess per branch.
- No branch-recency persistence is introduced.
</requirements>

## Feature Areas

| Area | Reference | Key Finding |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| CLI startup and source discovery | `references/cli-source-discovery.md` | Stage initial Git choices, filter branches on demand, and abbreviate matching OIDs in one batch. |

## Source Files

Original spike source files are preserved in `sources/` for complete reference.
