# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-08)

**Core value:** A developer can accurately review repository-grounded changes chosen by a developer or coding agent and return precise, drift-detectable feedback the agent can act on.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — exact-runtime-tarball

## Current Position

Phase: 04 (exact-runtime-tarball) — EXECUTING FINAL CANDIDATE
Plan: 4 of 4 — Task 1 uses the existing GitHub production configuration
Status: executing
Last activity: 2026-09-09 — Existing production variable read in memory; no duplicate local configuration file required

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20% — 1 of 5 milestone phases complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions.

- [v1.5]: Standard MIT replaces the proprietary license direction and the abandoned permission-restriction interview. Commercial reuse, modification, redistribution and resale are permitted under MIT. Preserve third-party notices, runtime-only npm packaging, and maintainer rights/sensitive-history and dual-licensor exact-text publication gates; do not turn those gates into additional MIT recipient restrictions.
- [v1.5]: Use OIDC trusted publishing from the approved public repository without long-lived credentials; preserve eligible automatic provenance and make only verified release/attestation claims.
- [v1.5]: Verify one exact runtime-only tarball before registry mutation, then bootstrap with one usable non-`latest` release before stable OIDC publication.
- [v1.5]: Publish the public MIT skill only after its separately installed CLI prerequisite exists; the CLI retains all review authority.
- [v1.5]: Preserve existing review, export, and voluntary-support behavior across every released installation path.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 5] Re-check then-current trusted-publisher/provenance eligibility and actual attestation evidence; public source or OIDC authentication alone is not a provenance claim.
- [Phase 5] Confirm npm scope/package ownership and protected workflow identity before the bootstrap release.
- [Phase 3 accepted risk] Retain artifacts 9907668126 and 9928300866 and their private backups under the owner's exact disposition despite the unremediated notice finding; do not claim third-party permission/compliance or change retention settings.
- [Phase 4] The configuration gate is resolved through the existing GitHub production variable, with its fingerprint matching the prior review. One real configured candidate is being prepared. Final read-only custody and attributable digest-bound approval remain required; no publication or source push is authorized.
- [Publication boundary] Phase 3 published commit ff72519969da8d2c0761c9533ccb27b809cd17bb. Later local evidence and completion commits are not automatically authorized for pushing.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 3 edited: Reconciled v1.5 Proprietary Distribution with approved public source and reviewed history; preserved all phase numbers, dependencies, and 19 requirement assignments
- 2026-09-08: Reconciled v1.5 MIT Distribution after the user explicitly abandoned proprietary restrictions. Phase order, all 19 requirement assignments, runtime-only packaging and unrelated publication safety gates remain unchanged.
